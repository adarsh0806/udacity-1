#Project Description: Tournament Planner

This is a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two files: 

* `tournament.sql`defining the database schema (SQL table definitions)
* , `tournament.py`is the code for the module with different functions.
